# Harvey Mudd Combat Robotics Tutorial Bot

This repository contains the finished CAD model of the tutorial bot. Information on how to lead the tutorial is in this file.

Looking through this and creating the bot yourself before leading the tutorial would be smart.

## First half of the tutorial

#### Estimated time, 3 hours

In the first half, everyone starts by remaking several part files.

1. `support_bar`: walk everyone through this one, as it's the first part.

2. `nut_strip`: Save the file support_bar, and then save as nut_strip. Now you can modify nut strip without changing support_bar.

3. `top_plate`: The countersunk holes need to be in the right place, people can cut any design they want into the material. Before, cutting the design, have everyone check the mass of the plate. After, recheck the mass.

4. `6_inch_wheel`: Here we learn about rotating around a line, and also get to look at the material picker in detail.

5. `1_inch_id_bushing`: Talk about bushings and their usefulness, more practice with material choice and rotation.

6. The rest of the pieces don't add much to learning about the robot, so we'll give those in the next tutorial.


## Second half of the tutorial

#### Estimated time, 3 hours

In the second half, everyone assembles the parts together into the finished bot.

1. Everyone needs to download the repository here, and then delete the file `robot.SLDPRT`

2. If people made their own designs in the first part, they can replace those files with their own

3. Everyone creates a new assembly and imports the bottom plate, nut strips, and support bars in, using the thumbtack tool.

4. People attach all those parts, learning about concentric mates and coincident mates.

5. People import the rest of the parts and attach those using concentric and coincident mates.

6. Fuck, this teaches nothing but concentric and coincedent, I probably have to redesign the damn thing to use a wider variety of mates.
